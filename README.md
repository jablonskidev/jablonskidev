# Let's help developers learn

I **help developers learn** because I like **code**, **words**, and **people**. Let's help developers together.

Reach out to me about:
- **Developer education & docs:** I teach developers and lead systems of developer-facing resources. I can do both high-level planning and nuts-and-bolts implementation. I ran the curriculum at [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) and am a founding member of the [Python Documentation Editorial Board](https://peps.python.org/pep-0732/). I also coauthored the bestselling book [Python Basics](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Basics-Practical-Introduction-ebook/dp/B0BCN4H62C) and was the primary reviewer for [CPython Internals](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCNSDSYP).
- **DevOps & DevSecOps:** As a Staff Education Engineer at CircleCI, I helped devs achieve velocity and confidence with the tools and best practices that would help them move forward. As a Technical Instructional Designer at GitLab, I created effective training systems.
- **Linux:** My love of open source has brought me back to Linux. I want to go deeper with understanding how it works and further with using it to solve real problems.
